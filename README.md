# ATM-System
A console-based ATM simulation that allows users to securely log in, check account balances, make deposits and withdrawals, and view transaction history. This project is built using classes such as ATM, Bank, User, Account, and Transaction to manage and organize essential banking functions. Ideal for learning OOP principles and simulating basic ATM operations.
