# Object-Oriented Design

I learned and practice some object-oriented principles, including:
Encapsulation: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes to control access and ensure data integrity.
Abstraction: Complex details are hidden from the user, providing a simplified interface. 
Polymorphism: Different types of accounts (e.g., savings, checking) share a common interface for transactions.
